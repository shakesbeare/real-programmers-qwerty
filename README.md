# Why? 

I spent about a year rocking ThePrimeagen's [real programmer's
dvorak](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards) before finally deciding to
switch back to qwerty. While this helped to minimize the diffculty with
keybindings in applications and video games, the symbol layout offered me real
health benefits as well as being wildlly convenient. You haven't lived until you
can press `=` with your index finger and your delimiters are all only a single
button press away. 

And so I went searching for an alternative. I found
[this](https://git.sr.ht/~renerocksai/real-prog-qwerty) layout, inspired from
the same source, but it made a few blunders that I didn't care for. Namely, it
pretty much changed the whole symbol layout compared to the original -- except
for the delimiters. So, I elected to create my own edition. 

This version keeps the vast majority of the symbols in the same approximate
location (where possible, the qwerty layout has letters in places where dvorak
has symbols). Generally, it only one major change: 

I put $ on the shift layer. I send people code blocks and write documentation a
fair amount. Having immediate access to \` is very convenient. I write ~ very
infrequently, so trading around these various symbols made sense.
